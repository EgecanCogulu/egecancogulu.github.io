### Abstract 
Skyrmion racetrack memories are highly attractive for
next-generation data storage technologies. Skyrmions are noncollinear
spin textures stabilized by chiral interactions. To achieve a fastoperating memory device, it is critical to move skyrmions at high
speeds. The skyrmion dynamics induced by spin−orbit torques
(SOTs) in the commonly studied ferromagnetic films is hindered by
strong pinning effects and a large skyrmion Hall effect causing
deflection of the skyrmion toward the racetrack edge, which can lead
to information loss. Here, we investigate the current-induced
nucleation and motion of skyrmions in ferrimagnetic Pt/CoGd/(W
or Ta) thin films. We first reveal field-free skyrmion nucleation
mediated by Joule heating. We then achieve fast skyrmion motion
driven by SOTs with velocities as high as 610 m s
−1 and a small
skyrmion Hall angle |θSkHE| ≲ 3°. Our results show that ferrimagnets
are better candidates for fast skyrmion-based memory devices with low risk of information loss
