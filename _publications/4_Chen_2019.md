excerpt: "This study investigates spin current transport in a YIG/NiO/YIG trilayer, revealing a spin Seebeck effect (SSE) signal increase at low temperatures due to paramagnetic effects in the GGG substrate, and identifying NiO's spin diffusion length as ∼3.8 nm, which aids understanding of spin currents in magnetic insulators."

### Abstract 
We present a study of the transport properties of thermally generated spin currents in an insulating ferrimagnetic-antiferromagnetic-ferrimagnetic trilayer over a wide range of temperature. Spin currents generated by the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) in a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) YIG/NiO/YIG trilayer on a gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate were detected using the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) in Pt. By studying samples with different NiO thicknesses, the spin diffusion length of NiO was determined to be ∼3.8 nm at room temperature. Surprisingly, a large increase of the SSE signal was observed below 30 K, and the field dependence of the signal closely follows a Brillouin function for an S=7/2 spin. The increase of the SSE signal at low temperatures could thus be associated with the paramagnetic SSE from the GGG substrate. Besides, a broad peak in the SSE response was observed around 100 K. These observations are important in understanding the generation and transport properties of spin currents through magnetic insulators and the role of a paramagnetic substrate in spin current generation.
