### Abstract 
Ultra-thin films of low damping ferromagnetic insulators with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy have been identified as critical to advancing spin-based
electronics by significantly reducing the threshold for current-induced magnetization switching while enabling new types of hybrid structures or devices.
Here, we have developed a new class of ultra-thin spinel structure
Li0.5Al1.0Fe1.5O4 (LAFO) films on MgGa2O4 (MGO) substrates with: 1) perpendicular magnetic anisotropy; 2) low magnetic damping and 3) the absence of
degraded or magnetic dead layers. These films have been integrated with
epitaxial Pt spin source layers to demonstrate record low magnetization
switching currents and high spin-orbit torque efficiencies. These LAFO films on
MGO thus combine all of the desirable properties of ferromagnetic insulators
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, opening new possibilities for spin
based electronics.
