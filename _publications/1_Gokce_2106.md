excerpt: 'Resistance drift of the amorphous states of multilevel phase change memory (PCM) cells is currently a great challenge for the commercial implementation of a reliable multiple-bit-per-cell memory technology. This paper reports observation of a stable intermediate state for a multilevel PCM cell that is achieved through nonuniform heating with a square current injection top electrode. Drift coefficient of the intermediate state is an order of magnitude lower than reset and has weaker temperature dependence. Using finite-element simulations and an analytical model for the subthreshold current-voltage characteristics, based on thermally activated hopping of charge carriers across Coulombic donor-like traps, we conclude that the defect density is two orders of magnitude larger in the intermediate state. We attribute the low drift coefficient of the intermediate state to a large number of stable interfacial defects which dominate the electron transport. Current findings give way to a more stable ultrahigh-density PCM device.'
