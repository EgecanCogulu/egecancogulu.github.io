excerpt: 'This thesis focuses on experimental investigations of detection and control of Neel order in insulating antiferromagnetic thin films, specifically Î±-Fe 2 O 3 and NiO. Antiferromagnetic materials have been getting increasing attention from the spintronics community because of their interesting properties and for potential applications in information processing. Some of these properties are zero net magnetization, low magnetic susceptibility, and very fast intrinsic spin dynamics with frequencies in the THz regime. Detecting and manipulating antiferromagnetic order electrically and reliably is a crucial milestone for realizing antiferromagnetic devices, but also an experimentally challenging one.'
