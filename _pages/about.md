Hi, my name is Ege.  I am currently working on building this site. 
In the meantime, you can check out my [resume](/cv/) and [publications](/publications/).

 About
======
 I am a Data Scientist with a background in Physics and Engineering.

Currently, I am working as a Senior Data Scientist for [Happy Returns, a UPS Company.]( https://happyreturns.com/ "Happy Returns, a UPS Company.") I analyze and interprete complex data sets, while enabling our team to make data-driven decisions and innovate returns solutions. My focus areas are predictive modeling,  A/B testing and machine learning.

My graduate research was on current induced spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic materials. I worked with large data sets resulting from spectroscopy and microscopy experiments, supervised by [Andy Kent](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/andrew-d-kent.html "Andy Kent") in [Center for Quantum Phenomena, New York University.](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/physics/research/center-for-quantum-phenomena.html "CQP")

 I am planning to post stuff that I find insteresting in [posts](/year-archive/) section.
