Hi, my name is Ege, welcome to my personal website. You can check out my [resume](/cv/) and [publications](/publications/).

If you're curious about using bootstrapping for calculating confidence intervals and for evaluating A/B tests, check out [my blog post!](https://egecancogulu.github.io/posts/2024/11/ab-testing/)

 About me
======
 I am a Data Scientist with a background in Physics and Engineering.

Currently, I am working as a Senior Data Scientist for [Happy Returns, a UPS Company.]( https://happyreturns.com/ "Happy Returns, a UPS Company.") I analyze and interpret complex data sets, while enabling our team to make data-driven decisions and innovate returns solutions. My focus areas are predictive modeling,  A/B testing and machine learning.

My graduate research focused on current-induced spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic materials. I worked with large data sets resulting from spectroscopy and electron microscopy experiments, supervised by [Andy Kent](https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/andrew-d-kent.html "Andy Kent") in [Center for Quantum Phenomena, New York University.](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/physics/research/center-for-quantum-phenomena.html "CQP")

 I post stuff that I find interesting in [posts](/year-archive/) section.

Below is an Ising model simulation that will be featured in a future blog post.
