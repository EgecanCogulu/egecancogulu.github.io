<h2>Education</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ph.D in Physics, New York University, 2022</li>
  <li>B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Bogazici University, 2015</li>
  <li>B.S. in Physics (Double Major), Bogazici University, 2015</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experience</h2>

    <strong>Senior Data Scientist, Happy Returns a UPS Company</strong> <em>(Nov 2023 - Present)</em>
    <ul class="sub-list"> 
      <li>Led the design, implementation, and analysis of multi-round A/B tests to evaluate the effects of choice availability on customer behavior, resulting in 4% increased foot traffic for preferred partners.</li>
      <li>Optimized shipping cadence of 10,000 unique shipping centers using statistical modeling and time-series forecasting, saving ~5% in shipping costs (monthly ~$50,000).</li>
      <!-- <li> Collaborated with product and engineering teams on the development of a machine learning-based fraud detection system, improving precision and recall to balance false positives and negatives, resulting in a 30% reduction in fraud-related losses.</li> -->
    </ul>
    <strong>Data Scientist, Happy Returns by PayPal</strong> <em>(May 2022 - Nov 2023)</em>
    <ul class="sub-list">
      <li>Developed a linear predictive model to forecast usage of shipping supplies for 10,000 locations, resulting in a 80% reduction in stock-outs.</li>
      <li>Created data visualization dashboards and reports using Excel, Tableau and Looker to track success metrics for cross-functional projects that were adopted by multiple departments.</li>
    </ul>

    <strong>Research Assistant, Center for Quantum Phenomena, NYU</strong>  <em>(Sep 2016 - May 2022)</em>
    <ul class="sub-list">
      <li>Collected and analyzed 100s of GBs of image data from electron microscopy experiments, using methods such as peak finding, edge detection, background subtraction, non-linear filtering and feature aligning. Developed interactive tools for 3D visualizations using Jupyter notebooks. </li>
      <li>Analyzed multi-dimensional voltage data as a function of temperature, electric current, magnetic field strength and direction. Extracted fit parameters by modeling the response analytically and numerically.</li>
